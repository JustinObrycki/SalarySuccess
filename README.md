# SalarySuccess

This project seeks to tackle the issue of salary negotiation fairness between employers and applicants. We're developing a web application that ensures both parties' desired salary information remains confidential through a negotiation algorithm. Users search and apply for jobs, and once they have passed the employers interview, the web application allows the applicant and employer to proceed with a negotiation process. Our aim is to create a user-friendly platform that combines the accessibility of SalaryExpert with the functionality of sites like Indeed, offering job listings and easy-to-understand negotiations. With our web application, users will have the necessary tools to confidently navigate salary negotiations and job searches.

In the ideal case, both the future employee and the employer should not know either desired salary. However, if the employer gets ahold of such information, the future employee would be held at a disadvantage with their possible salaries. We aim to help prevent employees being taken advantage of by employers. Our website will therefore help them get a salary that they deserve with the use of a zero knowledge proof that has a salary negotiation function, so neither party knows the other's value. The website we are creating is aimed to be easily accessible for users, so that they will no longer have to walk into interviews or search for job applications unprepared without a proper salary negotiation tactic.

Our website will ask you some details about your desired job location, current or past employment title, and desired salary. Once that is inputted, it then calculates and gives you a recommended salary based on your location and title that allows you to negotiate with similar salary job applications in that field. The website then shows the list of job applications that are in your desired location, in your area of expertise and close to the recommended salary range. The website will be similar to that of SalaryExpert but will also be more compact in the sense that all the job applications and recommended salary negotiations will be in front. We aim to make the website easily understandable for the user. Therefore our website will be a mix of what SalaryExpert has and the features of other websites such as Indeed, which search and show the user possible job applications. All the necessary information, such as job applications and the information previously inputted will be directly visible to the user, allowing them to have ease of access and ease of editability, if there were anything the user would want to change.
